# MECH2300 Trebuchet Group Project
In this project, I partnered with two team members to design a trebuchet that can launch a 50g payload through various distances and get to experience lot of hands-on task and problems. We also get to use hand tools placed inside toolbox, clamps, cutting and drilling machine which have played a huge part in assembling our system.
